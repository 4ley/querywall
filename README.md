Autopilot protection for your WordPress against malicious URL requests.

## How it works
QueryWall analyzes all incoming HTTP requests and silently blocks malicious queries containing risky strings like wp-config.php, eval code, base64_ encrypted code, and many more.

## Features
* Plug'n Play Firewall
* Simple, fast and solid
* Upload, activate, ready and done
* Works in background
* Identifies and forbids a wide range of malicious queries including [5G/6G Blacklist](https://perishablepress.com/6g-beta/)

## Installation
Upload, activate and done. Once active, QueryWall will automatically terminate any connection that is malicious.
